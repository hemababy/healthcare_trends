# Healthcare Trends Analysis

This project analyzes healthcare trends using data from [destatis Genesis](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online/data?operation=sprachwechsel&language=en) online portal sources. The goal is to provide insights into the healthcare industry and identify areas for improvement.

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of healthcare system metrics in Germany from 1991 to 2022. The dataset includes information on the number of hospitals, hospital beds, patients, occupancy rates, and other relevant indicators. The project aims to understand the trends and patterns in the healthcare system over the years, and how changes in hospital infrastructure and patient metrics have influenced each other.

Key research questions addressed in this project include the evolution of the number of hospital beds and beds per 100,000 inhabitants, changes in the number of hospitals, correlation between the average length of stay and the average occupancy of hospital beds, differences in hospital bed occupancy and average length of stay between different years, changes in occupancy rate over time, and trends in the number of patients and patients per 100,000 inhabitants.

The project uses Python for data analysis, with libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. The results of the analysis provide insights that can inform resource allocation decisions and help optimize the healthcare system.

Please refer to the `healthcare_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for the detailed analysis and code.
